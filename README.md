# Classification of Mango Varieties Using Support Vector Machine Method with LBP and Gabor Filters
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a plant that is visually difficult to distinguish due to similarities among its varieties. The three most commonly encountered mango types include Gadung mango, Manalagi mango, and Arumanis mango. Advances in technology using machine learning approaches have successfully identified leaf characteristics through digital image texture analysis. This study aims to classify mango varieties based on leaf texture to assist farmers and consumers in recognizing mango types quickly and accurately. The classification method used is Support Vector Machine (SVM), aided by texture feature extraction using Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gabor Filter, and a combination of both methods. In a testing scenario involving a total of 450 image samples and several parameter combinations for feature extraction, the results showed an accuracy of 68% for the LBP method, 83% for the Gabor Filter method, and 94.4% for the combined LBP and Gabor Filter method.
